Flower - Yes! I'm finally out of that garbage puddle!
Announcer - Sure.

Announcer - Hey Pibby.
Announcer - I've thought about what you said, and I've de-ided to help you save this world and get rid of the dar-ness or whatever you -all it.
-Pibby smiling at Announcer-
Flower - Enough talking! Let's just move on!
Flower - You! Weird looking David! You lead the way!
Pibby - What did you just call me?
Flower - I dunno, Bibby? Just lead the way, chop chop!
Pibby - *what a way to greet the person who saved you...*

TennisBall- Guys!
Announcer - Huh?
-looks-
Flower - Look guys! It's Tennis Ball!
-walks near-
TennisBall - I'm trying to use the Mutal Mind Reader on Golfball but it's not working!
Pibby - Hmm, We can help!
TennisBall - I think the way to get out of the darkness is to be motivated!
Pibby - And a way to be motivated is by singing.
Flower - Oh yeah! That's how I got out!
Pibby - I still don't think its the actual way though?
Announcer - It doesn't matter, We already saved one -ontestant, we need to try saving another one.
Pibby - Yeah! Let's do it!
TennisBall - Golfball! Hang in there!
