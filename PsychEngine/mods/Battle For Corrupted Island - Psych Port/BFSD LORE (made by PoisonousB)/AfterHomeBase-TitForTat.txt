-van-
Pibby: What is this place?
Ruby: It's yoyleland!
Bubble: The berries are very tasty here!
Pibby: Shouldn't we grab some?
Flower: Wait, Those berries have a side effect where once you eat them you'll turn into metal!
Pibby: Nevermind then.
-1 second silence-
*pibby sees someone in a yoylebush*
Pibby: Wait! Ruby can you stop the van for just a second?
Ruby: *offended cough* It's a Freesmart Super-
Flower: That doesn't matter.
-Pibby exits the van-
-Pibby with her sword walks closer to the yoyle bush with someone in it-
-Pibby slices half the yoyle bush-
-Woody-
-classic woody scream-
Ruby: Hey! It's Woody!
Ruby: Hi Woody!
Woody: Sigh... (the sigh when he's safe from elimination on bfdi)
Pibby: Hey! Another survivor!
Ruby: Anyway, Since we're already outside...
Ruby: Let's grab some yoyleberries!
Bubble: Hey guys! I'm gonna go that way, I think I see something there.
Pibby: Ok, Good luck.
Ruby: Hey Pibby! Try this yoyleberry!
Pibby: Wouldn't that turn me,
Pibby: Y'know, Into metal?
Ruby: C'mon just try it! Don't worry, I've got a Yellow Tomato that Pin gave me years ago.
Ruby: If you eat this you'll turn back to your non-metally self!
*Its rotten*
Pibby: I guess it wouldn't hurt to try?
*Pibby grabs yoyleberry*
*Pibby about to eat it*
Flower: *gasp* Hey! Look out!
Pibby: Huh?
