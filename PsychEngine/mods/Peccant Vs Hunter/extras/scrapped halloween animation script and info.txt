animation starts with monk dressing in her costume
she exits the shelter and the next shot is of arti’s shelter
she opens the door after monk knocks 
arti gives her a grenade which monk seems to be nervous of and tries to hand back to arti
next shelter is saint’s in which monk does the same as before and saint gives her a blue fruit
gourmand’s shelter, he turns around and seems to be crafting something 
he turns back around and gives her a lantern mouse which monk seems interested by and yet freaked out by
rivulet’s gives her a batfly
spear’s gives her one of his spears from his tail, which monk gets weirded out by but accepts anyways
enot’s gives her the egg which she declines heavily and quickly walks away
monk arrives at hunter’s
they open the door and it cuts to monk’s pov
with hunter’s eyes being completely dark with no lighting or shading
the screen cuts to black after “hunter’s” pupils start glowing red
wait thats not hunter
after a few seconds gulesothet jumpscares the viewer and cuts back to the video, now showing gulesothet staring at the viewer with his wide grin and smaller eyes
monk’s corpse is beside him and the surrounding area is blood filled and fiery
